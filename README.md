# Memory-Maestro
It is a memory game which tells you how much good your memory is!!!!!
At each level a box got pressed by the computer you have to remember the ordering of previous boxes and pressed all of them in order and include the box which got pressed by the computer last at the last of the order

I use
HTML- for static content on the screen
CSS- for the style
JS- to give animation on the fly
